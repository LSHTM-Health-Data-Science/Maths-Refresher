Introduction
=======================
This document contains a brief refresher on key mathematics and statistics topics. It is intended for the use of students taking the MSc in Health Data Science at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

We expect students starting this programme to have covered these topics more thoroughly elsewhere. These are intended to be short notes to refresh the memory. It is also intended to serve as a reference during the programme.

At the end of the document, there are a number of short test-yourself quizzes.
